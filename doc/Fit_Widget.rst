This widget is developed to provide a *Graphical User Interface* to an end-user by
which either they can develop their own fitting functions in python or use the existing
fitting functions under different categories to analyze different kinds of one-dimensional
data sets. `LMFIT <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`_ is extensively used within this widget.
