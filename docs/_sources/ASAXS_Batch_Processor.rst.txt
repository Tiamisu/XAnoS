ASAXS data collection involves measurements of SAXS data at several energies below the energy edge of the element of interest from the sample, background, standard samples (Glassy Carbon, Water etc). Sometimes SAXS data are also collected from empty container holding the sample and air background. After the data collection one needs to perform necessary background subtractions and absolute intensity normalizations for all the data. For this purpose, depending upon the sequence of data collection two batch processing widgets are developed:

1. ASAXS_Batch_Processor_1_
2. ASAXS_Batch_Processor_2_
